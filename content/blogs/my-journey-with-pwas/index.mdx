# 📱 My Journey with Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)  

## 🚀 Introduction  

When I first heard about **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**, I was amazed by their ability to bring a native app-like experience to the web. The idea of building **fast, reliable, and installable** web apps excited me, so I decided to dive in and explore their capabilities.

## 🔹 What is a PWA?  

A **Progressive Web App** is a web application that offers **offline capabilities, push notifications, and a native-like user experience**. PWAs follow these key principles:  

✅ **Reliable** – Works offline or on low-quality networks.  
✅ **Fast** – Quick loading and smooth performance.  
✅ **Engaging** – Provides an immersive, app-like experience.  

A PWA must include:  
1. **Service Worker** – Enables offline support and caching.  
2. **Web App Manifest** – Allows the app to be installed.  
3. **HTTPS** – Ensures security.

## 🛠️ Building My First PWA  

I started by converting a simple web app into a **PWA using service workers and a manifest file**. We published our first PWA for Android and iOS for SU Advantage.
