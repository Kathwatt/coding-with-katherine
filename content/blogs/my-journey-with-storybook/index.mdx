# ðŸ“– My Journey with Storybook  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Storybook  

Working on our app, I used **Storybook** to develop and document **React components** in isolation. This approach made UI development **faster, more organized, and scalable**, while ensuring consistency across the application.

## ðŸŽ¨ Why I Chose Storybook  

âœ… **Component-Driven Development** â€“ Build and test UI components independently.  
âœ… **Visual Testing** â€“ See components in different states without running the full app.  
âœ… **Easy Collaboration** â€“ Designers, developers, and testers can review components.  
âœ… **Supports Multiple Frameworks** â€“ Works with React, Vue, Angular, and more.
