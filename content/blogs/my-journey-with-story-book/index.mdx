# My Journey with CSS

## Introduction

As a web developer, I’ve tried many CSS frameworks over the years. Each one offers its own strengths, but none of them really clicked with me until I discovered **Tailwind CSS**. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that has completely changed the way I approach styling websites. In this blog post, I’ll share my journey with Tailwind, the challenges I faced, and how it has made me a more efficient and confident developer.

## What is CSS?

Before diving into my journey, let's quickly define what Tailwind CSS is. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, which provide pre-built components (e.g., buttons, cards, navbars), Tailwind is a utility-first framework. This means that instead of writing custom CSS for each component, you build your UI by combining small utility classes directly in your HTML.

For example:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-lg">Click Me</button>
```
